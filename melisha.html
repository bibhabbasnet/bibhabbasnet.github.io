                Happiest birthday sister. Sounds cringe ik but so does brother if u know what i mean.
                Anyway i wish u have the happiest birthday ever. It might not be the best birthday ever tho cause obviously future ma better hola bachha ma khatra vathyto hola. But whatever see this is how i fucked up. Okay detail ma lanxu la ek din text grya xa yo ta padna vyauxes hola hai it will be kinda long tho..... anyway so ive came to the realization that the gifts that matter the most is creative ones. i hope so. u prolly have everything u want and hamle gift deko ksto k lagxa so tyo man parena vane this is like backup ig??? idk atleast the effort counts ...or thats what i read that day SAT ko essay thyo ta USEF ma padeko tesma gift kei barema huda kk thyo and gift element materials vnda ni surprise le ramro banauxa and effort counts type...so anyway fast forward to today....hijo dekhi nai hola estai 2/3 din dekhi i had been thinking maybe do sth extra so made a webpage boom lol. anyway how i fucked up is i overestimated how much i knew about coding ig. i thought i could make this page relatively faster but turns out i had already forgotten half the shit i knew so there is no way this is gonna be complete by 12 am cause i stqarted it at like 10 pm and format/ design garna na ayera ma pagal vaisake. so its already 11 43 pm now and im typing this. What am i even doing i should be wishing u happy birthday and here i am self obsessed lol. anyway that is how i fucked up and ajkal esto bela ta kabita ni furdauina so sorry for nothing extra. expectation vs reality vayo tried making sth super unique but ended up making sth super shit. and im writing a journal instead a wish and that is just me ig. im literally typing everything im thinking rn. annoyed nahulaaa. so ill probably miss ur 12 am post and garna ni man lagdaina aajkal khaiii anyway i searched what i had and i liked this video the most so yei haldiye yo page ma consider it the post ig. <br>
                <br>
                Anyway whats been up man, sanchai holas happy holas navaye ni happy hune tya ishan payena vanera rune haina yet....ki paisakis? tyo ni thaxaina lol.. Back to the wish, Be happy sadhai aru kura testai ho paxi paxi thuli holis bday haru paxi paxi ko ma sangai navaiyela vet nahola who knows contact nai nahola but still u be happy. cause thats all that matters thulo vayexi talai mero yaad aauxa ki nai hola hai kunai din aaile nai ta birsi sakis xd,,,jk lecture sunaune haina.. but i was wondering birsis ki nai was wondering mero bday vako vaye eslai yaad hunthyo hola ki nai prolly hunthyo hola and all that stuff....turns out hune raixa (got the invitation so). idk if this thing of writing whatever that comes in my mind is a good idea but if i am selective about words then ta k ek paragraph ko text ta hunxa hola anyway i think u might wanna get inside my mind haha for a while mero thought ta estai random ra psychotic hunxa ... and... k vnne ill wish u a  small happy birthday stay happy text 12 baje if i dont get lost in this typing and missed the time but then still id be typing this as a wish to u so in a sense merai ho first wish cause 1159 ma ni typing 1201 smma ni typing but skip that shit i might not send this to u at all... another problem was yo website haru design grda laptop ma grya hunxa ani phone bata webpage kholyo vane laptop ma jsto banako ho testo aaudaina these letters might overlap ur thopda and it will look ugly and i dont have enough time and expertise to make it mobile ready in time. maile talai call grxu hola ta? group call ta hunna hola hai.. group nai harayo koi boldaina (haseko emoji) anyway call gare ni k vnxu hola maile happy birthday vnxu hola. ani yo webpage pathauda laptop ma khol vnxu hola ani tero laptop kata hola ani jharko manxas hola or worse dad mom ko room ma hola ani lyauna namilne hola or anything like that ma matra ho phone vnda badi laptop enjoy grne manis. 11 59 vayexa brb....lol offline xas jsto xa lmao etro kk sochya haha anyway, ishan le txt gryo hola hai makkha parera padira hola on nai xa vane ni even better call nai gryo hola oh its 12 btw....tyo duita namuna ko story ayexa haha so now the question is if ur awake and i dont wanna wake u if not aru le phone grne hola issan le grne hola ka disturb grdinu  xd and if pandit sir no longer crush then jiskako ma sorry...back to where i was i feel hella akward writing this all of a sudden. 18 pugi sakis hai thuli vaisakis lol so this shit might seem hella cringe and i kinda look like im trying too hard or too much right ?????? Maybe i am creative or sth unique ko naam ma jpt boldai basiraxu. feri huna pani ta naya kura testo kei ta xaina vanna lai. 1205 vayexa nidako xaina vane ta eso text herde hune ho ....but pandit ko story ko photo is hella wierd idk why i think so....<br>

But then again j sukai soch...this is what came into my mind as a way of putting some effort into it. iwld have appreciated it more than gifts ig, but then idk maybe not .; its just what i felt jado vayooooo laptop ma tipe gryaxa tyo ni uthera basera with external keyboard. delivered ta vayexa messenger ma its 12 17 sutya this ki thenas aba vanexi lol... <br>
